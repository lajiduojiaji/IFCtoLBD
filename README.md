This repository presents the results of our ongoing work to create a usable converter to convert Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) STEP formatted files into 
Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples that follow the small ontologies devised in  the  World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Linked Building Data Community Group (W3C LBD-CG)
(https://github.com/w3c-lbd-cg/).

Proceedings of the 6th Linked Data in Architecture and Construction Workshop:
[The IFC to Linked Building Data Converter - Current Status](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2159/04paper.pdf).

It is recommended to use OpenJava 15. OpenJava can be downloaded from [https://jdk.java.net/15/] (https://jdk.java.net/15/)

## Precompiled binaries

Precompiled applications are available in the published release.
https://github.com/jyrkioraskari/IFCtoLBD/releases

* Desktop application: IFCtoLBD-Desktop Java 8

These are runnable JAR files. If the Java installation is fine, the file can be run by clicking it. 
When converting large files, `run.bat` can be used. It is also faster since it allows the program to use more memory for the calculation.


Also Windows 10 installations are availabe. The zip files contain script files to run the program neatly in the windows operating system. 

If the program does not start, try the following command at the command line: `java -jar IFCtoLBD-Desktop_Java_8.jar`.

## Compiling the code
The converter can be compiled using maven and Java JDK (the above link). Maven can be downloaded from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.

First, make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable point to the JAVA JDK directory. JRE is not enough. Then run the following commands:

```
cd IFCtoRDF
call mvn clean install
cd ..

cd IFCtoLBDGeometry
call mvn clean install
cd ..

cd converter
call mvn clean install
cd ..

cd desktop_java8
call mvn clean install
cd ..

cd IFCtoLBD_OpenAPI
call mvn clean install
call mvn enunciate:docs install
cd ..
```
The best way to create a runnable [Java 15] (https://jdk.java.net/15/) program is to 
1. Use an Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/) installation,
2. Import the runtime definition:  Eclipse:/Project Explorer/IFCtoLBD_Desktop_Java15/others/Main 15.launch
3. Run as "Main Java 15"
4. Export:Java/Runnabe Jar file/Next
5. Launch configuration:"Main 15 - IFCtoLBD Desktop Java15", Package resource libraries into generated JAR
6. Select destination file and Finish.

An example command line usage of the program is:

```
java -jar IFCtoLBD.jar Duplex_A_20110505.ifc http://uribase out.ttl
```

## Maven
The Maven library was published on 29th of May, 2020.

How to use the code:
```
new IFCtoLBDConverter("c:\\in\model.ifc", "http://example.uri/", "c:\\out\\file.ttl",2, true, false, true, false, false, true);
```

## IFCtoLBD Python Implementation

The example implementation can be found in the IFCtoLBD_Python  subfolder

Installation:

pip install JPype1

```
# !/usr/bin/env python3

import jpype

# Enable Java imports
import jpype.imports

# Pull in types
from jpype.types import *

jpype.startJVM(classpath = ['jars/*'])

from org.linkedbuildingdata.ifc2lbd import IFCtoLBDConverter

lbdconverter = IFCtoLBDConverter("https://dot.dc.rwth-aachen.de/IFCtoLBDset",  3)

model=lbdconverter.convert("Duplex_A_20110505.ifc");

model.write(jpype.java.lang.System.out)
jpype.shutdownJVM()
```


## IFCtoLBD OpenAPI Implementation

An Restful OpenAPI implementation for IFCtoLBD converter.  

A test installation:
http://lbd.arch.rwth-aachen.de/IFCtoLBD_OpenAPI/apidocs/


### Swagger.json description for the services

http://lbd.arch.rwth-aachen.de/IFCtoLBD_OpenAPI/apidocs/ui/swagger.json


### Docker for the Open API interface

Install Docker Desktop:  https://www.docker.com/get-started

Command-line commands needed to start the server at your computer;
```
docker pull jyrkioraskari/ifc2lbdopenapi:latest

docker container run -it --publish 8081:8080 jyrkioraskari/ifc2lbdopenapi


```
Then the software can be accessed from the local web address:
http://localhost:8081/IFCtoLBD_OpenAPI

## Blog
### April 6, 2021  Support for European languages
The program code was modified so that the default backslash notation for UTF-8 characters is removed. äÄöÖåÅßüÜáÁàÀâÂ should be human-readable.

### October 13, 2020  Testing the software
The sofware was tested to function with https://jdk.java.net/15/

### October 5, 2020  Testing the software

## Frequently asked questions

1. What does it mean when IFCtoLBD says Java heap space?

   - The most probable situation for this is when a large file is converted. Try to start the program using `run.bat`. 

2. Why does the program say: *"Error: Cannot determine which IFC version the model it is: [IFC2X2_FINAL]"*

   - IFC 2x2 Final was published as early as 2003, 14 years ago. There are still some test files that are generated using this version. Support for this may be added.  Currently the supported IFC versions are:  IFC2x3TC1, FC2x3FINAL, IFC4, IFC4 ADD1 and  IFC4 ADD2.

3. Nothing happens when I start the program.

   - Check that Java 8 is installed, open a command prompt
     at the directory where IFCtoLBD-Desktop_Java_8.jar is located. Run the following command:
     `java -jar IFCtoLBD-Desktop_Java_8.jar`

4. In Windows, I cannot open the program by double clicking the file
   - Open a command prompt as admin
   - Run the following commands:
   
   ```
   assoc .jar=jarfile
   type jarfile="your java installation directory\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "%1" %*
   ```

   where *your java installation directory* is the base directory where your Java runtime is installed.
